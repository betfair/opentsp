.TH COLLECT-STATSE 1
.SH NAME
.B collect-statse
- derive time series from a flow of Statse records
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B collect-statse
.RB [ -tv ]
.BI -f " file"
.P
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B collect-statse
implements a Statse pipeline that adapts the incoming stream of Statse records
into a time series format. It resolves data format mismatch making it possible
to store event-based metric data (e.g. from web logs) in a time series database
like OpenTSDB, which normally would be incompatible with event-based data.
.P
.BI -f " file"
.RS
Set path to the configuration file.
.RE
.P
.B -t
.RS
Test configuration file, signalling success via exit code.
.RE
.P
.B -v
.RS
Print debugging information.

.P
Statse's main use is in application performance monitoring. Statse pipeline
summarises performance of entire application cluster by periodically applying
an aggregation function (mainly 99th percentile, aka p99) on response times
submitted by servers that make up the cluster. Such global, cluster-scoped p99
is convenient to reason about, and the pipeline outputs it as a time series
refreshed every few seconds (Aggregator.SnapshotInterval).
.P
Statse forwarder listener binds to 127.0.0.1:14444 accepting Statse record
submissions from local applications. Every record is evaluated against
user-defined filter (Forwarder.Filter), and on success forwarded to the
aggregator listener (Forwarder.AggregatorHost).
.P
Statse aggregator listener binds to *:14445 accepting Statse records relayed by
remote forwarder instances, and writing these records to temporary memory
store. Periodically, it calculates p99 based on the stored records, and writes
it to standard output in the OpenTSDB format.
.P
Aggregator depends on forwarder to modify the records to include the
tag
.BR host ,
which must be set to fully-qualified domain name of the forwarding server.
.P
Aggregator reserves the tag
.B error
for internal use. A record that includes this tag will be ignored.
.P
.SH CONFIGURATION FORMAT
The configuration
.I file
holds a JSON object that configures the two main stages of Statse pipeline:
forwarding and aggregation.
.P
The forwarding-stage settings are:
.P
.BR Forwarder.AggregatorHost " (string)"
.RS
Name of the host running
.B collect-statse
that is marked to perform continuous statistical aggregation. Default: localhost
.RE
.P
.BR Forwarder.Filter " (array)"
.RS
Filter for the forwarded records. Uses the same logic as
.B Filter
from
.IR tsdb-forwarder (8) "",
except the rules operate on intermediate Statse records rather data points of a
time series.
.P
The filter must set the
.B host
tag. It may also set the
.B cluster
tag to enable computation of cluster-scoped p99.
.RE
.P
The aggregation-stage settings are:
.P
.BR Aggregator.SnapshotInterval " (string)"
.RS
The interval between runs of the aggregation function on the stored records.
Default: 10s.
.RE
.P
.SH EXAMPLE
The below example showcases all settings, including a message filter that adds
two standard tags, adds a metric prefix, and blocks records that include a tag
that corresponds to HTTP path, which would otherwise lead to OpenTSDB namespace
blowup.

.SH BUGS
Independent submitters sharing a forwarder must arrange to use unique OpenTSDB
namespaces. This is easily achieved by prepending unique identifier to the
metric name of every outgoing record, for example the application's name.
Failing that, the records will be merged.
