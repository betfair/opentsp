.SH NAME
.B tsp-controller
- control the time series pipeline
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tsp-controller
.RB [ -t ]
[\fB-f\fI file\fR]
[\fB-l\fI addr\fR]
.P
.B tsp-controller -version

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tsp-controller
is a service that receives control requests from pipeline components, and handles
them according to the policy defined in
.IR file .
.P
.BI -f " file"
.RS
Set path to the configuration file. Default: /etc/tsp-controller/config
.RE
.P
.BI -l " addr"
.RS
Set listen addr. Default: :8084
.RE
.P
.B -t
.RS
Test configuration file, signalling success via exit code.
.RE
.P
.B -version
.RS
Display version information and exit.

.P
.SH CONFIGURATION FORMAT
The configuration
.I file
holds an XML document that configures
.BR tsp-controller .
The global
.B <config>
element includes the elements:
.P
.BI "<filter path=" file "/>"
.RS
Path to a program that generates custom filtering ruleset. Default: /etc/tsp-controller/filter
.P
The extra rules are prepended to the filter array. If
.I file
does not exit, no extra rules are added. However,
.BI tsp-controller (8)
always appends the usual rules setting the host and cluster tags.
.P
The program must output a filter array as specified in
.IR tsp-forwarder (8)
under the
.B Filter
section. The full program invocation is:
.P
.RS
.I file
.B program host
.RB [ cluster ]
.RE
.P
.B program
is the name of requesting program, for example ``tsp-forwarder''.
.B host
is the name of the requesting host.
.B cluster
is the name of the enclosing cluster, and may be unset.
.RE
.P
.BI "<hostgroup id=" id ">"
.RS
Declare a host group identified by
.IR id .
Host groups may nest. For example, one might define a hostgroup ``web'' that
nests the groups ``web.api'' and ``web.cache''.
.P
An innermost hostgroup includes cluster elements:
.P
.BI "<cluster id=" id ">"
.RS
Declare a cluster identified by
.IR id .
A cluster is like hostgroup, except (1) it is an innermost group,
(2) it acts as a directive to the pipeline to assign value
.I id
to the
.B cluster
tag of all points originated in the cluster.
.P
A cluster element includes host elements:
.P
.BI "<host id=" id ">"
.RS
Declare a host identified by
.IR id ,
which is a fully-qualified domain name.
.P
A host element may include the elements:
.P
.BI "<statse aggregator=" enabled " interval=" interval ">"
.RS
If
.I enabled
is true, the host is marked as statse aggregator for its cluster. All instances of
.BI collect-statse (8)
in the cluster will forward records to this host for cluster-wide analysis.
At most one host in a cluster may be marked as aggregator. In case no host
is marked, each host will analyse its own data, i.e. cluster-wide summaries
will be unavailable.
.P
The
.I interval
controls aggregation snapshot interval. Default: 10s

.P
.BI "<network path=" file "/>"
.RS
Path to a file declaring the traffic routing topology. Default: /etc/tsp-controller/network
.P
If
.I file
does not exist,
.BI tsp-controller (8)
assumes it runs on OpenTSDB server, and routes all time series traffic to the server.
.P
The
.I file
may include the following elements:
.P
.BI "<aggregator host=" host "/>"
.RS
Address of the host running
.BI tsp-aggregator (8)
.RE
.P
.BI "<restrict host=" host "/>"
.RS
Limit controller's scope. Handle requests only for hosts matching the
.I host
regex. Multiple elements are OR-ed together. If no element is specified,
controller has unlimited scope (handles all requests).
.RE
.P
.BI "<subscriber id=" id " host=" host " direct=" direct " dedup=" dedup "/>"
.RS
Register traffic subscriber identified by
.IR id .
The
.I host
setting is the address of subscriber host. If
.I direct
is true, the subscriber will receive multiple connections, one per
.BI tsp-forwarder (8)
instance. If false, the subscriber will receive single combined connection from
.BI tsp-aggregator (8) .
If
.I dedup
is true, the received feed will be deduplicated. By default, subscribers
receive combined connection without deduplication.
