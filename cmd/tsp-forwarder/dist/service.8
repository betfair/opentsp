.TH TSP-FORWARDER 8
.SH NAME
.B tsp-forwarder
- forward time series
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tsp-forwarder
.RB [ -tv ]
[\fB-f\fI file\fR]
.P
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tsp-forwarder
is an agent that collects data points from plugin programs, and writes them to a
time series relay.
.P
.B tsp-forwarder
rereads the configuration
.I file
when it receives a hangup signal, SIGHUP, by executing itself with the name and
options it was started with.
.P
.BI -f " file"
.RS
Set path to the configuration file. Default: /etc/tsp/config
.RE
.P
.B -t
.RS
Test configuration file, signalling success via exit code.
.RE
.P
.B -v
.RS
Print debugging information.
.RE
.P
.SH CONFIGURATION FORMAT
The configuration
.I file
holds a JSON object that configures
.BR tsp-forwarder .
The settings are:
.P
.BR CollectPath " (string)"
.RS
Path to directory containing collection plugins. Default: /etc/tsp/collect.d
.P
Collection plugin is an executable program that creates data points by writing
OpenTSDB-formatted lines to standard output.
.B tsp-forwarder
monitors the directory for file additions/deletions, and starts/kills processes
in response. If crashed, the process is restarted; if exit code 13 was
returned, the restart is delayed by 1 hour. The process must exit after
encountering an error writing to standard output.
.RE
.P
.BR Filter " (array)"
.RS
Ruleset evaluated for every data point prior to a send to the relay.
.P
The rule settings are:
.P
.BR Match " (array)"
.RS
Match is a list of conditions that must hold for the rule actions to be
executed. If a condition is false, the rule is ignored and the evaluation
proceeds to the next rule. If
.B Match
is unset, the rule actions are executed unconditionally.
.P
The head array element (index 0) is a regex matching the dot-delimited metric
name. The remainder of the array (indicies 1+) is an optional tags match list
in the form of key, regex pairs. If a tag with the given key is absent, the
regex is passed an empty string.
.P
At most one regex may include submatch syntax (the unescaped parentheses).
.RE
.P
.BR Set " (array)"
.RS
An action that mutates the forwarded data point. Structurally, Set is like
Match except it (1) reassigns metric name or tags, or assigns new tags, (2)
expands regex submatches by substituting the ${N} symbol with N'th match.
.P
Assigning an empty value is a no-op.
.RE
.P
.BR Block " (boolean)"
.RS
An action that causes the data point to be ignored. Default: false
.RE
.P
All regular expressions support the extended features, for example the + operation.
.P
The default filter is:
.P
.ft CW
.nf
[
	{
		"Block": true
	}
]
.fi
.ft P
.RE
.P
.BR LogPath " (string)"
.RS
Path to the log file. Default: /var/log/tsp/forwarder.log
.RE
.P
.BR Relay " (object)"
.RS
Relay definitions. The object key gives the relay an internal name for use in
log entries. The object value holds the settings object specified below.
.P
Each defined relay is a mirror: it is sent every data point. If it cannot keep
up with the throughput, its points are queued in memory up to a limit (100K
points). Once the queue fills, new points are dropped until the throughput
problem is resolved.
.P
The settings are:
.P
.BR DropRepeats " (bool)"
.RS
Enable deduplication, a space-conserving optimisation. Drops data points that
don't contribute to line plots, i.e. those contained by existing line segments.
Default: false
.RE
.P
.BR Host " (string)"
.RS
Server address in host:port format. If port is not provided, it defaults to
4242. The protocol used is the OpenTSDB line-based telnet protocol. For load
balancing, multiple servers may be defined using comma to separate server
addresses. The traffic will be sent to all listed servers, partitioned using
a hash of time series identifier.
.RE
.P
.BR MaxConnsPerHost " (string)"
.RS
Limit number of client connections established to each host address in the
.B Host
list.
Default: 1
.RE
.P
.BR OnQueueFull " (string)"
.RS
Error handling for the queue full condition. One of: Drop, DropAndLog.
Drop causes irrecoverable data loss. DropAndLog is like Drop except it
will attempt to log lost points to
.BR LogPath .
Default: Drop
.RE
.RE
.P
.SH EXAMPLE
Forward data points to a single relay:
.P
.ft CW
.nf
{
	"Filter": [
		{
			"Match": [
				"",
				"host",
				"^$"
			],
			"Set": [
				"",
				"host",
				"server101.example.com"
			]
		}
	],
	"Relay": {
		"tsd": {
			"Host": "tsd.example.com",
			"DropRepeats": true
		}
	}
