.SH NAME
.B collect-netscaler
\- collect metrics from NetScaler load balancer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B collect-netscaler
.RB [ -version ]
.RB [ -uv ]
.RB [ -a
.IR path ]
.RB [ -i
.IR interval ]
.I host
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B collect-netscaler
polls the specified load balancer
.I host
for metric data,
translates it to OpenTSDB format, and writes the resulting
lines to standard output.
.P
Metrics are obtained from the Nitro API, which is a HTTP interface
exposed by NetScaler load balancers from Citrix Systems.
The metrics are rooted in the
.B netscaler
branch of the metrics hierarchy.
.P
.BI -a " path"
.RS
Set path to a file containing the authentication secret.  The file
contains single JSON object with string properties: Username,
Password. The default path is
.BR /dev/stdin .
.RE
.P
.BI -i " interval"
.RS
Set polling interval. Default: 7s.
.RE
.P
.B -u
.RS
Disable transport security. Use HTTPS but skip certificate verification.
.RE
.P
.B -v
.RS
Print debugging information.
.RE
.P
.B -version
.RS
Display version information and exit.

.SH EXAMPLE
Poll netscaler01.example.com using the given auth credentials:
.P
.ft CW
.nf
#!/bin/bash

exec collect-netscaler netscaler01.example.com << 'EOF'
{
        "Username": "opentsp",
        "Password": "13donkeys"
}
EOF
.fi

.SH BUGS
At startup,
.B collect-netscaler
begins a learning process aimed at discovering the available
VServer-to-service bindings. This process may take a few minutes to
complete because of performance bugs in the Nitro API. While it is
in progress, some metrics are unavailable.
.P
Nitro API suffers from regular crashes. It recovers automatically, but
while it is restarting, no data is being collected. These data gaps can
be correlated to i/o timeout errors logged on standard error.
.P
Most NetScaler metrics are updated on a ~7-second schedule on the
Nitro API side. It is possible for
.B collect-netscaler
to make a query that results in a response payload that is an exact duplicate
of the preceding response's payload. Counters carried in such stale response
cause visualization artifacts: when they are used to plot rate-per-second
of a counter, they cause the plotted line to incorrectly drop to Y=0.
This makes it difficult to distinguish true drops from the artificial ones.
Luckily, some metrics are available in two variants:
total counter and rate-per-second gauge. For these metrics,
.B collect-netscaler
emits only the pre-computed rate-per-second gauge
(which does not lead to visualization artifacts),
and ignores the total counter.
.P
Some VServers are deliberately omitted. A VServer must
receive traffic within the past 24 hours in order to be considered
for collection. This restriction protects OpenTSDB server from
creating metrics for defunct VServers.
